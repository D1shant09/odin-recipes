    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <P><b>Dough:</b></P>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package rapid-rise yeast</li>
        <li>¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F/43 degrees C)</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm milk (115 degrees F/46 degrees C)</li>
        <li>¼ cup orange marmalade</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 cup bread flour</li>
        <li>½ cup old-fashioned oats</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Filling:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups chopped fresh cranberries</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 egg white</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <P><b>Glaze:</b></P>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon frozen orange juice concentrate</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water in a large bowl; stir. Stir in warm milk, marmalade, 1 whole egg, and 2 tablespoons melted butter to combine. Whisk flour, oats, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into yeast mixture until moistened.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a flat surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat both sides. Cover bowl and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine cranberries, brown sugar, and 6 tablespoons water in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook until cranberries begin to soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Off heat, stir in walnuts, 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, and lemon juice; cool.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface; roll into a 10x20-inch rectangle.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 egg white and 1 teaspoon water together; lightly brush over dough. Spread cranberry filling over dough, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Roll up dough tightly, starting from 1 long edge; seal edges and cut off any tapered sides with no filling.</li>
        <li>Transfer roll to a large baking sheet; join ends together to form a ring. Cut 2/3 of the way through dough, at 1-inch intervals, using sharp kitchen shears. Gently twist each slice to expose swirled filling. Gently reshape dough into a perfect ring. Cover ring; let rise until doubled in volume, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Stir confectioners' sugar and orange juice concentrate together in a small bowl; whisk in enough water to reach a glaze-like consistency. Drizzle glaze over tea ring; let glaze set before slicing ring.</li>
    </ol>
